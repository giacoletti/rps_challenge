## Updates/Improvement plans

The game at this stage is against the cpu algorithm.
Further improvements can be made, for instance a 2 players version can be built using [Express](http://expressjs.com/), but further studies are required.

Needs improvements for mobile use, adjustments with Semantic UI can help fixing styling issues.
